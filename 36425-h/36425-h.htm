<h2><a name="pagev"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
v</span>PREFACE.</h2>
<p>In a day when so much has been written on almost every
Scripture subject it requires some apology for offering anything
further; but as different trains of thought are more suited to
one than another, they may serve as useful remembrancers,
although there may be nothing particularly new about them.&nbsp;
The writer of the following pages, being in the evening of life
and much retired from its active duties by failing health, often
endeavours to look through the lengthening shadows of the evening
to the glory which shall be revealed, and delights to ponder over
those passages of <a name="pagevi"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
vi</span>Holy Writ which form the basis of our faith in
Christ.</p>
<p>The following pages make no attempt at scholarship.&nbsp; The
author thankfully accepts and believes the revelation which God
has given us in Holy Scripture, and has endeavoured to set forth
a plain <i>scriptural</i> statement of the successive steps or
development of that revelation, culminating in the Gospel of
Christ.</p>
<p>When our Lord says of the final issue of His judgment,
&ldquo;These&rdquo; (speaking of the wicked) &ldquo;shall go into
everlasting punishment, but the righteous into life
eternal,&rdquo; I believe He perfectly understood the subject,
and meant what He said.&nbsp; When Paul also, writing of himself
and his fellow-Apostles, said &ldquo;Knowing therefore the terror
of the Lord, we persuade men,&rdquo; I believe he
meant&mdash;they persuaded <a name="pagevii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. vii</span>men &ldquo;to flee from the wrath to
come,&rdquo; and take shelter in &ldquo;the blood of the
everlasting covenant&rdquo; (Heb. xiii. 20); according to the
words, &ldquo;It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the
living God who hath said, Vengeance belongeth unto Me, I will
recompense saith the Lord&rdquo; (Heb. x. 30, 31; and 2 Thess.
ii. 6&ndash;9).</p>
<p>I have been a fond reader of Holy Scripture from my youth, and
have from time to time studied much that has been written in
support of its genuineness and authenticity; but now in the
retrospect of the past I find no evidence for the general truth
of that Scripture at all to compare with the words of our Lord
Jesus Christ&mdash;&ldquo;If any man will do His (the
Father&rsquo;s) will, he shall know of the doctrine whether it be
of God or whether I speak of myself&rdquo; (John vii. 17).</p>
<p><a name="pageviii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
viii</span>&ldquo;The secret of the Lord is with them that fear
Him, and He will show them His covenant&rdquo; (Ps. xxv.
14).&nbsp; As it is all-important to know that the foundations
are sure, and will stand in the day of trial, I have set down in
these pages the train of thought which has proved most confirming
to my own faith, and trust that some of those who love the Truth
as it is in Jesus may find it helpful to themselves.</p>
<p>We live in eventful times.&nbsp; There is much abroad in the
world to excite alarm.&nbsp; When Atheism and Infidelity are
making strenuous efforts to extend their withering influence;
when Roman Catholicism and a kindred ritualism are invading our
country, there is abundant need to stick to the Law and the
Testimony, lest the curtains of darkness should be again spread
over it.&nbsp; <a name="pageix"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
ix</span>But notwithstanding that the picture may be somewhat
gloomy, it is by no means all on one side; by various
instrumentalities the Gospel is being largely and successfully
proclaimed, and the message of salvation <i>through Christ
alone</i> is now carried to every class, and almost from house to
house, in a manner never before witnessed; and the lowest haunts
of vice and misery are at least opened to the town missionary,
the Bible-woman, or the evangelist, where but recently the police
could not venture single-handed; and many are the brands plucked
from the burning, so that among these, as well as among the
social circles above them, a rich and powerful wave of Gospel
blessing is rolling over the land.</p>
<p>If I have fairly represented the teaching of the Bible, it is
all that I could <a name="pagex"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
x</span>aspire to.&nbsp; The many &ldquo;divers and strange
doctrines&rdquo; which in one or another way oppose the Gospel of
Christ, must be swept away before the grand truths which the
Bible sets forth, and which, when time is past and eternity
remains, will for ever be a theme of praise and thanksgiving to
the glorified beings who shall be accounted worthy to stand
before the throne, and swell the anthem of &ldquo;Glory and
dominion to Him who loved us, and washed us from our sins in His
own blood&rdquo; (Rev. i. 5, 6).</p>
<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1</span>CHAPTER
I.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">HOW JESUS FULFILLED THE LAW.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not come to destroy&rdquo; (the law and the
prophets) &ldquo;but to fulfil.&nbsp; Till heaven and earth pass,
one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law till all
be fulfilled&rdquo; (Matt. v. 17, 18).</p>
<p>The above solemn words of our Lord Jesus Christ, being part of
His Sermon on the Mount (as related by Matthew), appear to open
an interesting field of inquiry into an important portion of
Divine Truth as set forth in Holy Scripture.</p>
<p>In what manner did our Lord so fulfil the law given by Moses
that one jot or <a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
2</span>one tittle should in no wise pass unfulfilled?&nbsp; Was
it when He went to the Baptist, and <i>received baptism</i>,
because it became Him to fulfil all righteousness? (Matt. iii.
15).&nbsp; Was it when He sent the ten lepers whom He would heal
to show themselves to the priests (agreeably to Lev. xiv. 2; Luke
xvii. 14); or in another similar case, when He said, &ldquo;Go,
show thyself to the priest, and offer those things which Moses
commanded for a testimony unto them&rdquo;? (Mark i. 44; Luke v.
14).</p>
<p>Was it by attending the appointed feasts at Jerusalem, and
generally in other cases, recorded or not recorded, in which He
conformed, and was subject to the ritual which had been before
appointed?&nbsp; Or are we not to understand the words in a much
deeper sense than His personal submission to the Law?&mdash;that
of fulfilling, perfecting, and giving a living reality to all its
foreshadowing types, in themselves <a name="page3"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 3</span>dead and profitless; to seal, assure,
and make good all its promises to the obedient subjects of that
Law; all its threatenings to the disobedient; to open up to
mankind that rich inheritance prepared alike for the men of that
day and for us, foreshadowed by the land of promise flowing with
milk and honey; to perfect that which was lacking in those
offerings of atonement which in themselves could never take away
sins (Heb. x. 4)?</p>
<p>The ministry of our Lord Jesus Christ is revealed to us under
the two characters of an Apostle and High Priest (Heb. iii.
1).</p>
<p>1st.&nbsp; <i>As an Apostle</i>, to declare and teach the
principles of that Divine Truth, which distinguished the New
Covenant of life and salvation from the covenant of bondage to
ordinances then about to be abolished, which had been designed as
introductory to it; and to ordain and qualify His Apostles to
declare its principles more fully after His death and
resurrection.</p>
<p><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>For
obvious reasons the New Covenant could not be fully published
until the offering of Christ had fulfilled the Scriptures
relating to Him; and when the resurrection had declared Him to be
the Son of God with power.</p>
<p>Although our Lord had often pointed out to His Apostles that
in His life and actions He was fulfilling the Scriptures, it is
clear they did not fully understand their import until after the
Holy Ghost had descended on them on the Day of Pentecost, and
opened up to their minds, with a vivid remembrance, and clear
sunshine of heavenly light, all that Jesus had said and done,
giving to them that wonderful power and energy which they
afterwards exhibited, as well as those miraculous gifts of the
Spirit which were necessary to confirm their doctrine to
others.&nbsp; Thus we read that we ought to give a more earnest
heed to the things &ldquo;which began to <i>be spoken by the</i>
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>, <a name="page5"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 5</span>and were confirmed to us by them that
heard Him; God also bearing them witness, with signs and wonders,
and divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to
His own will&rdquo; (Heb. ii. 3, 4).</p>
<p>Our Lord had, on several occasions, as before observed, taken
care to instruct His disciples in the Scriptures which related to
Himself; but He did so more explicitly after His resurrection;
beginning at Moses and all the prophets, He expounded to the
<i>two</i> on their way to Emmaus the &ldquo;things concerning
Himself, in all the Scriptures&rdquo; (Luke xxiv. 27).&nbsp; And
when they had returned to Jerusalem, and had related to the
eleven (and others with them) what had happened in the way, He
stood in their midst, and confirmed their testimony, saying,
&ldquo;These are the words which I spake unto you, while I was
yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled which were
written in the law of Moses, <a name="page6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>and in the Prophets, and in the Psalms
<a name="citation6"></a><a href="#footnote6"
class="citation">[6]</a> concerning Me.&nbsp; Then opened He
their understanding, that they might understand the Scriptures,
and said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved
Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day&rdquo;
(Luke xxiv. 44&ndash;46).</p>
<p>When Jesus sent out His twelve disciples to preach, He said to
them,&mdash;&ldquo;He that receiveth <i>you</i> receiveth
<i>Me</i>, and he that receiveth <i>Me</i> receiveth <i>Him that
sent Me</i>&rdquo; (Matt. x. 40), so that in receiving the
Apostles&rsquo; doctrine and teaching, we receive Christ&rsquo;s
teaching.&nbsp; Also the same principle is set forth in John
xiii. 20, &ldquo;He that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth
Me; and he that receiveth Me receiveth Him that sent
Me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>2nd.&nbsp; <i>As a High Priest</i> our Lord is <a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>introduced in
the most solemn words of prophecy:&mdash;&ldquo;The Lord hath
sworn and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the
order of Melchisedec&rdquo; (Ps. cx. 4, quoted in Heb. vii.
21).</p>
<p>This most solemn form of utterance is seldom used in
Scripture.&nbsp; It occurs also when God sware to Abraham, that
in his seed all the nations of the earth should be blessed (Gen.
xxii. 16&ndash;18):&mdash;To the rebellious Israelites, that they
should not enter into His rest (Deut. i. 34, 35):&mdash;To Moses,
that he should not go into Canaan (Deut. iv. 21):&mdash;To David,
that his seed should endure for ever, and his throne unto all
generations (Ps. lxxxix. 3, 4).</p>
<p>It is treated in Heb. vii. 20&ndash;22 as exhibiting the
superior authority and character of Christ as a High Priest, in
comparison with the priesthood of Levi: &ldquo;For those priests
were made without an oath; but this with an oath; . . . and by so
much was Jesus made a surety of a better <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>testament.&rdquo;&nbsp; And again, in ver. 28: &ldquo;For
the Law maketh men high priests which have infirmity; but the
word of the oath, which was since the Law, maketh the Son, who is
consecrated for evermore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is also treated (Heb. vi. 16&ndash;19) as expressing the
absolutely unalterable counsel of God: &ldquo;Men verily swear by
the greater, and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of
all strife; wherein God, willing more abundantly to show unto the
heirs of promise the immutability of His counsel, confirmed it by
an oath; that by two immutable things, in which it was impossible
for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled
for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us.&rdquo;&nbsp;
That hope which is as an <i>anchor</i> to the soul, both sure and
steadfast.</p>
<p>The office of <i>an apostle</i> (or special messenger, or
messenger with special tidings), viewed separately, has nothing
of the <i>priest</i>; but the offices of teacher of <a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>the law,
mediator, and priest were combined in the Levitical priesthood;
and they were perfectly blended in the person of our Lord Jesus
Christ.&nbsp; Nevertheless the doctrine of the priesthood of
Christ could not be much developed or declared until the
abolition of the priests of Levi by the termination of that first
covenant, when Jesus declared, &ldquo;It is finished,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;gave up the ghost,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the veil of the
Temple was rent in twain&rdquo;&mdash;indicating that the
approach to the Divine Presence was opened to all.</p>
<p>During the patriarchal ages, the head of the family or house
appears to have combined in himself the patriarch and
priest.&nbsp; Noah, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, offered sacrifices
as well as Abel, though the recorded instances are few, and only
on very remarkable occasions; such as the coming out of the ark,
the call of Abram, the sacrifice of Isaac, the covenant to
Jacob.&nbsp; But we read that it was the <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>constant
practice of Job; for, after giving an account of the
burnt-offerings offered for each of his sons after their days of
feasting, it is added, &ldquo;thus did Job continually&rdquo;
(Job i. 5); and such was no doubt the practice of other
patriarchs.</p>
<p>At the close of Job&rsquo;s temptation, the Lord said to His
three friends that they should take seven bullocks and seven
rams, and go to Job, and offer up burnt-offerings, and Job would
pray for them, &ldquo;for him will I accept&rdquo; (Job xlii.
8).</p>
<p>Of the patriarchal religion we are told but little.&nbsp; The
Apostle Paul says, in Rom. v. 14, &ldquo;Death reigned from Adam
to Moses&rdquo;; in Rom. i. 20, that &ldquo;God&rsquo;s eternal
power and Godhead were clearly seen in the works of
creation,&rdquo; so that they were without excuse; and in Rom.
ii. 14, 15, that though without law they had a conscience bearing
witness to the law written in their hearts, accusing or excusing
their thoughts.</p>
<p><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>In the
earliest days, the power of God manifested in the works of
creation spoke to men more clearly than it may now speak to
heathen nations who know not God.</p>
<p>They spoke to Adam and Eve of the God whom <i>they knew</i>,
and had had intimate acquaintance with.&nbsp; The glory of Eden
and the events of their life there, with their disastrous fall
and expulsion, must have made an indelible impression on
<i>their</i> minds.&nbsp; Knowing their Creator they would have
no disposition to worship the sun, moon, or stars, as His
works.&nbsp; It would be contrary to all the subsequent history
of the dealings of God with His creatures to suppose our first
parents were driven out and left to their own devices as to the
means of reconciliation with Him; and though we are not expressly
told that sacrifice was offered by Adam, many think that the
first instruction in utilising skins for clothing, <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>referred to
the skins of animals offered in sacrifice. <a
name="citation12"></a><a href="#footnote12"
class="citation">[12]</a></p>
<p>At probably no very distant period from the Fall (described
as, &ldquo;In process of time,&rdquo; or &ldquo;in the end of
days&rdquo;), we find Abel offering the firstling of his flock,
an acceptable sacrifice to God; the same that was commanded by
the law of Moses.</p>
<p>When we take into account the length of Adam&rsquo;s life and
that of his sons, there is no difficulty in concluding that those
indelible impressions would be handed down to his posterity, with
the history of the Lord&rsquo;s dealings with him, and what had
been revealed to him as the means of propitiation, or being
reconciled to Him.</p>
<p>That there was a revelation before the Flood is evident, for
Abel offered an acceptable sacrifice, but Cain&rsquo;s was not
accepted; <a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>while the words addressed by the Lord to Cain, &ldquo;If
thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest
not well sin lieth at the door&rdquo; (Gen. iv. 7), clearly
indicate that Cain knew what was pleasing or displeasing to
Him.&nbsp; Enoch and Noah also walked with God so faithfully that
the one was translated, and the other, by his act of faith,
condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which
is of faith; very clearly showing that faith, rather than works,
was in those days the basis of salvation.</p>
<p>When we consider the terms in which the sacrifice of Christ is
set forth in the New Testament, as &ldquo;The Lamb slain from the
foundation of the world&rdquo; (Rev. xiii. 8); &ldquo;Preordained
before the foundation of the world&rdquo; (1 Pet. i. 20; Rom.
xvi. 25; Eph; iii. 9, 11; Col. i. 26; 2 Tim. i. 9; Titus i. 2;
Matt. xxv. 34); it would seem impossible to doubt that the great
principle of human redemption or reconciliation, set forth by <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>so many types
under the Law, and by the one Great Offering of the Gospel,
should not have had its initiative in the earlier means of grace
and pardon of the patriarchal times.</p>
<p>When the children of Israel came out of Egypt, a complete
system of priesthood was established by Divine command in Aaron
and his sons, assisted in the general labours of the Tabernacle
service by the remainder of the tribe of Levi.&nbsp; The
exhibitions of Divine power and majesty which accompanied the
giving of the Law from Mount Sinai were of a character to produce
the deepest and most lasting impression on those who witnessed
them.&nbsp; And as those institutions have a very important
bearing on the Gospel of Christ, it is important to review them,
as briefly as possible; and more especially as this portion of
Scripture is often not so much studied as it might be with
advantage by some of those who, taking a high view of <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>the essential
spirituality of the Gospel, are the less disposed to look into
the basis of that spiritual religion, which was laid in the
Mosaic law.</p>

<p class="gutsumm">PROVISIONS FOR THE PARDON OF SIN, AND
RECONCILIATION UNDER THE LAW.</p>
<p>The regularly ordained sacrifices were the
following:&mdash;</p>
<p>1st.&nbsp; <i>The daily sacrifices</i>.&nbsp; Two lambs of the
first year&mdash;one in the morning and the other in the evening
(and on the <i>Sabbath four lambs</i>, Num. xxviii 9); with their
meat- and drink-offerings of flour, oil, wine &ldquo;for a sweet
savour, an offering made by fire unto the Lord&rdquo; (Exod.
xxix. 38&ndash;41).&nbsp; &ldquo;This shall be <i>a continual</i>
burnt-offering throughout your generations at the door of the
Tabernacle of the congregation before the Lord, <i>where I will
meet with you</i>, <i>to speak there unto thee</i>&rdquo; (ver.
42).&nbsp; &ldquo;And I will dwell among <a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>the children
of Israel, and will be their God&rdquo; (ver. 45).</p>
<p>Whatever <i>other</i> sacrifices were commanded for any or
every day of the week, they were <i>additional</i> to these daily
offerings, with which nothing interfered.</p>

appearance of the new moon)&mdash;</p>

<p>a burnt-offering for a sweet savour, made by fire unto the
Lord.</p>
<p><i>Also one kid</i> for a <i>sin-offering</i>, and his
drink-offering (Num. xxviii. 11, &amp;c.).</p>
<p>3rd.&nbsp; On the 14th of the first month (Abib) the <i>Feast
of the Passover</i>, also called &ldquo;the <i>sacrifice</i> of
the Lord&rsquo;s passover&rdquo; (Exod. xii. 27).</p>
<p>It was a memorial festival throughout the generations of the
children of Israel, to mark their deliverance from bondage in
Egypt, and the special Providence <a name="page18"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 18</span>which protected them from the
destroying angel, who procured that deliverance by slaying all
the first-born of man and beast in Egypt.</p>
<p>A lamb of the first year, a male from the sheep or goats and
without blemish, was killed at even, and the flesh roasted with
fire was eaten by every household that night, while the
destroying angel was at work around them; but prior to this the
blood of the lamb had been sprinkled on the two side posts, and
upper door post of the houses, &ldquo;and the blood shall be to
you for a token. . . .&nbsp; And when the Lord seeth the blood,
He will pass over you;&rdquo; so that while every other house had
its dead, they ate securely under cover of the sprinkled
blood.</p>
<p>This festival was instituted on the departure of the children
of Israel from Egypt, and before the giving of the Law, or the
appointment of the priesthood of <a name="page19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>Aaron and his sons.&nbsp; As with the
patriarchal sacrifices, it was provided by the head of the
household.</p>
<p>In allusion to <i>subsequent</i> times, when their children
should inquire the meaning of the service, they were to say
&ldquo;It is the <i>sacrifice</i> of the Lord&rsquo;s
passover&rdquo; (Exod. xii. 27).</p>
<p>The Passover has a very marked reference to our Lord Jesus
Christ.&nbsp; Shortly before His death He said to His disciples,
&ldquo;With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you
before I suffer;&rdquo; and at that supper He said of the bread,
which as the master of the feast He broke, &ldquo;This is My body
which is given for you;&rdquo; and of the cup, &ldquo;This is the
New Testament in My blood, which is shed for you&rdquo; (Luke
xxii. 15&ndash;20).</p>
<p>4th.&nbsp; Immediately upon the Paschal feast followed, during
the next seven days, <i>the Feast of Unleavened Bread</i>, during
which were to be offered, <i>each day</i>&mdash;</p>

<p>for a <i>burnt-offering</i> (Num. xxix. 8).&nbsp; And one kid
for a <i>sin-offering</i> of atonement (Num. xxix. 11).</p>
<p>This was a day of great solemnity&mdash;&ldquo;It shall be a
holy convocation unto you, and ye shall afflict your souls&rdquo;
(Lev. xxiii. 27), &amp;c, &ldquo;Ye shall do no work; . . . it is
a <i>day to make atonement for you before the Lord your
God</i>&rdquo; (Lev. xxiii. 28); and whoever among the
congregation did not <a name="page23"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 23</span>afflict his soul, or whoever did any
work therein, was to be cut off from among his people (Lev.
xxiii. 29, 30).&nbsp; &ldquo;It shall be . . . a sabbath of rest,
and ye shall afflict your souls: in the ninth day at even, from
even to even, shall ye celebrate your sabbath&rdquo; (Lev. xxiii.
32).</p>
<p>The high priest was not to enter within the veil to the inner
tabernacle, except on this day, &ldquo;that he die not,&rdquo;
and then only with the blood of the sin-offerings for himself and
the congregation, peculiar to this day.</p>
<p>Before doing so he laid aside his ornamental garments and put
on a linen dress (Lev. xvi. 2&ndash;4).&nbsp; He took in his
hands a censer of burning coals from the altar of burnt offerings
and put on it a handful of incense, that the cloud of the incense
might cover the mercy seat, whereon the Lord appeared in the
cloud, &ldquo;that he die not&rdquo; (Lev. xvi. 12, 13).&nbsp; He
then took the blood of the sin-offerings, <a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>both for the
priest and people, within the veil, and sprinkled it with his
finger upon the mercy seat eastward, and before the mercy seat
seven times (Lev. xvi. 15, 16), to make an atonement for the Holy
Place, because of the uncleanness of the children of Israel, and
because of their transgressions in all their sins (Lev. xvi.
16).</p>
<p>This is the only sacrifice described in the Law, which
corresponds with the words in Hebrews xiii. 11:&mdash;&ldquo;The
bodies of those beasts whose blood is brought into the sanctuary
for sin, are burned without the camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No other blood was annually brought into the sanctuary (or
inner temple) by the high priest on behalf of the people, and
sprinkled on and before the mercy seat; and the flesh of these,
as well as of some other offerings, was burned without the
camp.</p>
<p>The service of this day required that in <a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>addition to a
bullock for a sin-offering, and a ram for a burnt-offering, to
make atonement for himself and his house (Lev. xvi. 3&ndash;6),
the <i>high priest should take of the congregation</i> of Israel
two kids of the goats for a sin-offering (Lev. xvi. 5); he was to
present the two kids at the door of the tabernacle (ver. 7), and
&ldquo;cast lots,&rdquo; one for the Lord and one &ldquo;for the
scape-goat&rdquo; (vers. 8 and 10).&nbsp; He killed the former
for a sin-offering for the people, and proceeded as already
described (p. 23).</p>
<p>In addition to the blood taken within the veil, the high
priest was to put some of it upon the horns of the altar, and
sprinkle it seven times upon it to hallow it (vers. 18, 19).</p>
<p>Then, as to the other, or scape-goat, Aaron laid both his
hands on the head of the live goat and confessed over him all the
iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their
transgressions in all their sins; putting them on the head of the
<a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>goat, and
sent him away by the hand of a fit man into the wilderness, and
the &ldquo;goat bore them away to a land not inhabited&rdquo;
(Lev. xvi. 21).</p>
<p>Although every sin-offering had a reference to the Lord Jesus
Christ, the kid offered on this day by the masses of the people
is treated in Heb. xiii. as having a very special application to
Him, from the blood having been carried within the veil and
sprinkled on the mercy seat, and from the body having been burned
without the camp.&nbsp; So Jesus, having suffered without the
gate, and having obtained eternal redemption for us, not by the
blood of others, but by His own blood, having &ldquo;given
Himself a ransom for all,&rdquo; entered not into the holy places
made with hands, but into Heaven itself, there to appear in the
presence of God for us.</p>
<p>Again, in the scape-goat, which was the complement of the
sin-offering, we have a reference to the Lord Jesus bearing away
<a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>our sins
&ldquo;in His own body on the tree,&rdquo; so that they should be
no more remembered against us (1 Pet. ii. 24).</p>
<p>9th.&nbsp; There remains one more appointed festival, <i>the
Feast of Tabernacles</i>, or ingathering (Exod. xxiii. 16) on the
fifteenth day of the seventh month, when the crops of wine and
oil had completed the harvest labours.&nbsp; It lasted seven
days, during which numerous sacrifices were ordained,
viz.,&mdash;</p>
<p>The 1st day, 13 bullocks, 2 rams, 14 lambs,</p>
<p>2nd &bdquo; 12 &bdquo; 2 &bdquo; 14 &bdquo;</p>
<p>3rd &bdquo; 11 . &bdquo; 2 &bdquo; 14 &bdquo;</p>
<p>4th &bdquo; 10 &bdquo; 2 &bdquo; 14 &bdquo;</p>
<p>5th &bdquo; 9 &bdquo; 2 &bdquo; 14 &bdquo;</p>
<p>6th &bdquo; 8 &bdquo; 2 &bdquo; 14 &bdquo;</p>
<p>7th &bdquo; 7 &bdquo; 2 &bdquo; 14 &bdquo;</p>
<p>with their meat and drink-offerings.&nbsp; And <i>each</i> of
the seven days <i>one goat for a sin-offering</i>.&nbsp; And on
the eighth day a holy convocation, with offerings of one bullock,
one ram and seven lambs, with accompaniments, <a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>and <i>one
ram for a sin-offering</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;These things shall ye do
unto the Lord in your set feasts, besides your vows, and your
freewill offerings, for your burnt-offerings, and for your
meat-offerings, and for your drink-offerings, and for your
peace-offerings&rdquo; (Num. xxix. 12&ndash;39).</p>
<p>The service of the Tabernacle and its offerings were supplied
by contributions of half a shekel per head on all that were
numbered, from twenty years old and upwards.&nbsp; The rich were
not to give more, nor the poor less.&nbsp; It was offered to the
Lord to make an atonement for their souls (Exod. xxx.
14&ndash;16).</p>
<p>As indicated in the latter portion of the above quotation
(Num. xxix. 39), besides these stated daily, monthly, and annual
sacrifices, which were of a public or general character, there
were&mdash;</p>
<p>1st.&nbsp; <i>Voluntary offerings</i>, which do not seem to
have been specially enjoined, nor to have had reference to any
particular <a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
29</span>sins, but arose from the voluntary will and devotion of
the person offering, and the priest sprinkled the blood round
about upon the altar; &ldquo;and <i>it was accepted for him to
make an atonement for him</i>&rdquo; (Lev. i. 2&ndash;5);
&ldquo;an offering made by fire of a sweet savour unto the
Lord&rdquo; (ver. 9).&nbsp; It was required to be a male without
blemish of the herd or of the flock, two turtle-doves, or two
young pigeons (vers. 2 and 10&ndash;17).</p>
<p>2nd.&nbsp; <i>Peace-offerings</i>, also for the most part
voluntarily, in which the offerer shared with the priest the
offering&mdash;a male or female of the herd without blemish, or a
lamb or goat (Lev. iii. 1, &amp;c.).</p>
<p>3rd.&nbsp; <i>The Sin-offering</i> for sins of ignorance
afterwards brought to light (Lev. iv. 13, &amp;c.).</p>
<p>4th.&nbsp; <i>The Trespass-offering</i>.&mdash;If any one
sinned in hearing swearing and not uttering it, or in any
uncleanness, or swearing, <a name="page30"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 30</span>he was to take a lamb or a kid (a
female), or two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, or, if too
poor for any of them, the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour,
&ldquo;and the priest shall make an atonement for him for the sin
which he hath sinned, and it shall be forgiven him&rdquo; (Lev.
v. 1&ndash;13).</p>
<p>In every case the offering was required to be perfect in its
kind, and without blemish.</p>
<p>The sin-offering was more especially for atonement; but the
voluntary and other offerings are spoken of as contributing
thereto (Lev. i. 3): coming from the voluntary will of the
people, they expressed the heart&rsquo;s devotion, and bore a
&ldquo;sweet savour to God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But in the days when Isaiah wrote, and when great corruption
prevailed, it is said, &ldquo;Incense is an abomination unto Me;
the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot
away with&rdquo; (Isa. i. 13).&nbsp; And Amos says, &ldquo;I will
not smell in your <a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span>solemn assembly&rdquo; (Amos v. 21).&nbsp; The people
drew near with the lip, but the heart was far from God (Isa.
xxix. 13); so the sacrifices bore with them no sweet savour of
devotion to Him.</p>
<p>In contemplating the mass of sacrifices thus noted, we may
easily enter into the feeling expressed by Paul (more especially
as regarded circumcision)&mdash;&ldquo;which neither we nor our
fathers were able to bear;&rdquo; and we can the more fully
appreciate the blessing of the Gospel, which has relieved us from
all such burdens, and given us individually a free access
(whether Jew or Gentile) to the Father of Mercies, through the
one only High Priest, Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>
<p>But it was not so much to point out the burdens which our
forefathers in the faith of Christ had to bear&mdash;burdens
which, nevertheless, were light compared with the burden of
unforgiven sin&mdash;that we have traced the requirements of the
law; but to point to <a name="page32"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 32</span>the testimony they bore to Christ and
His Kingdom.</p>
<p>Under the law no Israelite could obtain pardon for his sin
except through the <i>Priest</i>, who was the appointed
mediator&mdash;to him he brought the prescribed offering, and
slew it at the Tabernacle door; the priest received the blood,
and some of the internal fat; the former he sprinkled, and the
latter he burned, on the altar; and, in the words of the text,
&ldquo;<i>The priest shall make an atonement for his sin</i>,
<i>and it shall be forgiven him</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We may not be able to define the extent to which the Holy
Ghost was then enjoyed, but we cannot doubt that the testimony of
a conscience free of offence towards God was sealed on the mind
of the offerer when the atonement was made agreeably to the
words, &ldquo;Ye shall therefore keep my statutes and my
judgments; which if a man do he shall live in them&rdquo; (Lev.
xviii. 5).</p>
<p><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>The
Apostle Paul confirms this language, saying, &ldquo;The man that
doeth them&rdquo; (the statutes of the Law) &ldquo;shall live in
them&rdquo; (Gal. iii. 12); and when we consider the words of the
same writer: &ldquo;The children of Israel could not steadfastly
look to the end of that which is abolished&rdquo; (2 Cor. iii.
13), we need not suppose the offerers had, in general, any
understanding that what they did had a special relation to the
better Mediator to come.&nbsp; As in the case of the brazen
serpent they looked to it and were healed; so here they made
their offerings believing in their efficacy, and reaped the fruit
of pardon and peace.</p>
<p>This divinely-instituted law was enjoined on the people under
the most solemn assurances of blessings for obedience, and
cursings for disobedience, viz.: &ldquo;Behold I set before you
this day a blessing and a curse; a blessing if ye obey the
commandments of the Lord your God which <a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>I command you
this day: and a curse if ye will not obey the commandments of the
Lord your God, but turn aside after other gods&rdquo; (Deut. xi.
26&ndash;28; xxvii. 15&ndash;26; and ch. xxviii.).&nbsp; &ldquo;I
call heaven and earth to record this day against you, that I have
set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore
choose life, that both thou and thy seed may live, that thou
mayest love the Lord thy God, and that thou mayest obey His
voice, and that thou mayest cleave unto Him; for He is thy life
and the length of thy days: that thou mayest dwell in the land
which the Lord sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and
to Jacob, to give them&rdquo; (Deut. xxx. 19, 20).</p>
<p>They did what God had provided to enable them to walk with
Him, and when they erred or failed to keep His holy law they
brought the means of reconciliation He had appointed.&nbsp; In
such way a man might do justly, love mercy, and <a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>walk humbly
with his God, which is the whole duty of man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright, for the
end of that man is peace&rdquo; (Ps. xxxvii. 37), might be
applied to such an one, and the model may perhaps be useful in
enabling us to understand the higher perfection required by the
Gospel.&nbsp; &ldquo;If we walk in the light, as He is in the
light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of
Jesus Christ His Son cleanseth us from all sin&rdquo; (1 John i.
7).</p>
<p>If we look for the essential principle of this elaborate
system of priestly mediation for the forgiveness of sins, as well
as for presenting to God the freewill offerings or devotions of
the people, it will be found in the 11th verse of the 17th
chapter of Leviticus, viz.: &ldquo;For the life of the flesh is
in the blood, and I have given it to you upon the altar to make
an atonement for your souls; for it is the blood that maketh an
atonement for the soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>Such
were the conditions under which the law given from Mount Sinai
was presented to or enjoined on the people.&nbsp; They were to
choose between life or death, blessing or cursing, obedience with
the Divine favour, or refusal to obey, with the Divine
displeasure.&nbsp; The eyes of the Lord would be over the
righteous, and His ear open to their cry; but the face of the
Lord would be against them that did evil, to cut off the
remembrance of them from the earth&mdash;Ps. xxxiv. 15,
16&mdash;conditions so different as to constitute the highest
happiness man was capable of at that time, or the deepest
degradation and misery which he could endure in this life, with
no better prospect beyond.</p>
<p>The consequences of God&rsquo;s favour and blessing are set
forth with peculiar strength in Deuteronomy (see pp. 33, 34),
together with the consequences of His favour being withdrawn,
which we may do well to ponder; as the language quoted above <a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>from the
Psalms is adopted by the Apostle Peter as applicable equally to
Christian times, and the principles of the quotations from
Deuteronomy are equally applicable to the old or new
dispensations&mdash;viz., obedience to the revealed will of God
with life and blessing, or disobedience with death and
misery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He that despised Moses&rsquo; law died without mercy
under two or three witnesses; of how much sorer punishment,
suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under
foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant,
wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and done despite
unto the Spirit of Grace?&rdquo; (Heb. x. 28, 29).</p>

38</span>CHAPTER III.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">THE HEBREW SACRIFICES FROM THE CHRISTIAN POINT
OF VIEW.&nbsp; THE SACRIFICE OF CHRIST THEIR TRUE COMPLEMENT.</p>
<p>When we consider the bearings of the Mosaic laws on the
religion of Christ, it is impossible to avoid a careful attention
to the Epistle to the Hebrews, which so clearly sets forth the
unity of design between the different revelations, and the manner
in which the institutions of the former prefigured and led up to
the higher, purer, and holier covenant of the Gospel.</p>
<p>The mode in which the author deals with the highest subjects
and persons bespeaks for him the position of one of the chiefest
apostles, to whom abundance of <a name="page39"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 39</span>revelations had been made, and whose
mind was disembarrassed from the prejudices of the past, and
accepted without reserve the fully developed light and spirit of
the Gospel.&nbsp; Who else could venture on language like the
opening verses of this book; or those words in the second
chapter, &ldquo;<i>For it became Him</i>, <i>for whom are all
things</i>, <i>and by whom are all things</i>, in bringing many
sons unto glory, to make the Captain of their salvation perfect
through sufferings&rdquo; (Heb. ii. 10).</p>
<p>To him the transition from the Law to the Gospel is perfectly
natural and necessary.&nbsp; As the morning dawn passes on into
the perfect day, so the Law, having done its preparatory work,
merges into the glorious light of the Gospel of Christ; or, to
use the author&rsquo;s own simile, the Law decays, waxes old, and
vanishes away just as the glory of the Gospel appears.&nbsp; The
one must increase, the other decrease; the type be swallowed up
in the antitype.&nbsp; <a name="page40"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 40</span>Nothing is discordant; everything
fits naturally to its bearings on the other.&nbsp; Moses as
lawgiver gives place to the Prophet whom the Lord would raise up
to His people.&nbsp; The priesthood of Aaron and his sons is
superseded by the High Priesthood of Christ.&nbsp; The blood of
animals, which had no inherent healing power&mdash;by the blood
of Him, who (uniting the Divine and the human&mdash;God and Man),
&ldquo;through the Eternal Spirit, offered Himself without spot
to God,&rdquo; &ldquo;an offering and a sacrifice of a sweet
smelling savour&rdquo; for the sins of men.&nbsp; The beneficent
provisions of the Mosaic laws&mdash;of which Moses could say
(Deut. iv. 8): &ldquo;What nation is there so great, that hath
statutes and judgments so righteous as all this law which I set
before you this day?&rdquo;&mdash;give place to the yet purer
principles of the Gospel of Christ.</p>
<p>Had it not been for the long course of typical sacrifices,
continued through so <a name="page41"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 41</span>many ages, how would it have been
possible in the latter days to establish the value and efficacy
of the sacrifice of Christ?&nbsp; The sacrificial rites of
heathen nations, so degrading to morality and purity of thought
and life, would <i>alone</i> have led no one to imagine such a
sacrifice as His: although when viewed as corruptions of revealed
truth they have, as accessories, a valuable significance.</p>
<p>We propose now to look at the intrinsic value of the
sacrifices under the Mosaic institutions from the Christian point
of view, and the superiority of the sacrifice and religion of
Christ, as explained in the Epistle to the Hebrews.</p>
<p>Chapter 1 sets forth that God, who had formerly spoken to men
by <i>Prophets</i>, has now spoken to us <i>by His Son</i>, who,
being the brightness of His glory and express image of His
person, when He had by Himself <i>purged our sins</i>, sat down
at the right hand of the Majesty on high.&nbsp; <a
name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>Here is the
first recognition of the teaching and High Priesthood of
Christ.&nbsp; <i>He speaks to us the things of God</i>, <i>and
purges away our sins by Himself</i> (vers. 1&ndash;3).</p>
<p>Chapter 2 opens with the exhortation that for this reason we
ought to give the more earnest attention to what He taught. <a
name="citation42"></a><a href="#footnote42"
class="citation">[42]</a></p>
<p>Chapter 2 sets forth also that Christ had passed through
suffering, in order that He &ldquo;might be a merciful and
faithful <i>High Priest</i> in things pertaining to God, <i>to
make reconciliation for the sins of the people</i>&rdquo; (c. ii.
17).</p>
<p>Chapter 3 opens with an invitation to consider this
<i>Apostle</i> and <i>High Priest</i> of <a
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>our
profession, faithful in all things to Him that appointed
Him&mdash;far exceeding Moses in glory&mdash;for Moses was
faithful as a servant; Christ as a son over His own house (vers.
1&ndash;6).</p>
<p>Chapter 5 says, &ldquo;Every <i>high priest</i> taken from
among men <i>is ordained for men in things pertaining to God</i>,
that he may offer both gifts and <i>sacrifices for sin</i>&rdquo;
(ver. 1), that no man takes this honour unto himself, but he that
is called of God as was Aaron.&nbsp; So Christ glorified not
Himself, to be made a high priest; but He that said unto Him,
&ldquo;Thou art My Son, to-day have I begotten Thee!&rdquo; and
again, &ldquo;Thou art a Priest for ever after the order of
Melchisedec&rdquo; (vers. 4, 5, 6).</p>
<p>Further on, after setting forth, in the seventh chapter, the
surpassing excellence of the High Priesthood of Christ in
comparison with that of Aaron, and marking how exactly such a
High Priest was adapted to our every need, &ldquo;holy, harmless,
<a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>undefined,
separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens&rdquo;
(c. vii. 26), the Apostle sums up his argument in the eighth
chapter: &ldquo;Now of the things which we have spoken this is
the sum, We <i>have</i> such a High Priest, who is set on the
right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens&mdash;a
Minister of the sanctuary and of the true tabernacle, which the
Lord pitched and not man (Heb. viii. 1, 2).&nbsp; And inasmuch as
every high priest <i>is ordained to offer</i> both gifts and
sacrifices, it is <i>of necessity that this man have somewhat to
offer</i>&rdquo; (Heb. viii. 3).</p>
<p>Jesus was proved to be our High Priest by offering up His own
body for our sins, which is stated in the most explicit
terms.&nbsp; &ldquo;But Christ being come, a High Priest of good
things to come; . . . neither by the blood of goats and calves,
but <i>by His own blood</i> He entered in once into the holy
place, having obtained <a name="page45"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 45</span>eternal redemption (for us)&rdquo;
(Heb. ix. 11, 12).</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through
the eternal Spirit <i>offered Himself without spot to God</i>,
<i>purge</i> your conscience from dead works to serve the living
God?&rdquo; (Heb. ix. 14). (See also ver. 15.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor yet that He should offer Himself often, as the high
priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of
others; for then must He often have suffered since the foundation
of the world; but now once in the end of the world hath He
appeared to <span class="smcap">put away sin</span> <i>by the</i>
<span class="smcap">sacrifice</span> <i>of Himself</i>&rdquo;
(Heb. ix. 25, 26).</p>
<p>&ldquo;So Christ was once <i>offered to bear the sins</i> of
many,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i>, of all that look to Him for salvation
(Heb. ix. 28).</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the which will we are sanctified through the
<i>offering of the</i> <span class="smcap">body</span> <i>of</i>
Jesus Christ once for all&rdquo; (Heb. x. 10).</p>
<p>&ldquo;For by one offering He hath perfected <a
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>for ever them
that are sanctified&rdquo; (Heb. x. 14).</p>
<p>The Apostle Paul uses language equally explicit in Eph. v.
2:&mdash;&ldquo;And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us,
<i>and given Himself for us</i>, <i>an offering</i> and a
<i>sacrifice to God</i>, of a <i>sweet smelling
savour</i>.&rdquo; <a name="citation46"></a><a href="#footnote46"
class="citation">[46]</a></p>
<p>Having thus shown how, on the <i>principles</i> of the
<i>priesthood of Aaron</i>, the Lord Jesus had proved Himself to
be a priest, although of the higher and more perfect order of
Melchisedec&mdash;the order of righteousness and peace, and
everlasting endurance&mdash;this epistle points out in a very
conclusive manner the defects of the Mosaic institutions, which
were enjoined for a time only, to prepare the way, and lead up to
the enduring realities of the Gospel of Christ.&nbsp; And here we
cannot but notice again how completely the <a
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>Christian
mind of the author had passed from all the Jewish prejudices and
predilections of his former training, to regard everything in the
light and spirit of Christ; while far from disregarding or
repudiating that which he showed to be past, worn out, and
abolished, he draws from it his most powerful arguments in favour
of the New Covenant as required to complete the first, by making
good its typical meaning, and securing to all who had passed from
earth to heaven under the provisions of the Law, those blessings
which they had already entered on, upon the promise of the
sacrifice of Christ to come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the Law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in
of a better hope did; by the which we draw nigh unto God&rdquo;
(Heb. vii. 19).&nbsp; That better hope is stated to be the
&ldquo;blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered
Himself without spot to God,&rdquo; purging our conscience,
&amp;c. (Heb. ix. 13, 14)</p>
<p><a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
48</span>&ldquo;For the Law having a shadow (or shadowing forth)
of good things to come, and not the very image (or substance and
reality) of the things, can never by those sacrifices which they
offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto
perfect&rdquo; (Heb. x. 1).&nbsp; It was &ldquo;therefore
necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens, should be
purified with these, <a name="citation48a"></a><a
href="#footnote48a" class="citation">[48a]</a> but the heavenly
things themselves with better sacrifices <a
name="citation48b"></a><a href="#footnote48b"
class="citation">[48b]</a> than these&rdquo; (Heb. ix. 23).</p>
<p>The passage last quoted follows verse 22, which declares,
&ldquo;without shedding of blood is no remission&rdquo; (See also
Lev. xvii. 11).&nbsp; But if it was impossible that the blood
shed under the law of Moses (Heb. x. 4), should take away sins,
it is evident that other blood <i>must be</i> shed of which that
was typical, and which should be effectual for the purpose,
agreeably <a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
49</span>to Heb. ix. 15, referring to Christ; &ldquo;For this
cause He is the Mediator of the New Testament, that by means of
death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under
the first Testament, they which are called might receive the
promise of eternal inheritance.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the former
sacrifices there was a remembrance again made of sins every year
(Heb. x. 3).&nbsp; But after the one Sacrifice for ever it is
said, &ldquo;their sins and iniquities will I remember no
more&rdquo; (x. 17).</p>
<p>&ldquo;And having made peace <i>through the blood of His
cross</i>, by Him to reconcile all things unto Himself, whether
things in earth or things in heaven&rdquo; (Col. i. 20).</p>
<p>&ldquo;In <i>the body of His flesh through death</i>, to
present you holy and unblameable and unreproveable in His
sight&rdquo; (Col. i. 22).</p>
<p>Thus we are given to understand that the sins of future
generations, should be atoned by the one offering of Christ, as
well as those of past generations, so that all <a
name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>generations
alike owe their salvation to the one Mediator between God and
man, Jesus Christ, in whom &ldquo;all are made alive, and who is
the one only hope of glory.&nbsp; For as in Adam all die, so in
Christ shall all be made alive&rdquo; (1 Cor. xv. 22) in such
manner that if we are united to Him we partake of what is His,
and shall find in Him all that we can need as a Saviour,
Mediator, Intercessor, and Redeemer.</p>
<p>Nothing is of us; all from Christ.&nbsp; In Him is all the
fulness of the Godhead bodily (Col. ii. 9); full of grace and
truth (John i. 14).&nbsp; All power is committed to Him in heaven
and in earth (Matt. xxviii. 18).&nbsp; As maker and upholder of
all things, blessings, spiritual and temporal, are in His hand
(Heb. i. 2, 3); and in Him are hid all the treasures of wisdom
and knowledge (Col. ii. 3), and &ldquo;He is able to save them to
the uttermost that come unto God by Him&rdquo; (Heb. vii.
25).</p>
<p><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>Can we
not now with reverent feeling enter into somewhat of the deep
meaning of those few words of our Lord, &ldquo;<i>That thus</i>
<span class="smcap">it must be</span>&rdquo; (Matt. xxvi. 54)?
and of that awful scene which had just passed in the garden of
Gethsemane, when He had thrice prayed&mdash;&ldquo;<i>If it be
possible</i>, let this cup pass from Me; nevertheless not as I
will, but as Thou wilt&rdquo;&mdash;when His soul was
&ldquo;exceeding sorrowful even unto death&rdquo; (Matt. xxvi.
38, 39); and when &ldquo;there appeared an angel unto Him from
heaven strengthening Him (Luke xxii. 43); when His sweat was as
it were great drops of blood falling to the ground&rdquo; (Luke
xxii. 44).</p>
<p>The words referred to were spoken when Peter had made an
attempt at resistance, and smitten off the ear of the High
Priest&rsquo;s servant, who came with others to take Jesus, and
when He had rebuked Peter, saying, &ldquo;Thinkest thou that I
cannot now pray to my Father, and He <a name="page52"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 52</span>shall presently give Me more than
twelve legions of angels?&nbsp; <i>But how then shall the
Scriptures be fulfilled</i> that <i>thus it must be</i>?&rdquo;
(Matt. xxvi. 51&ndash;54).&nbsp; &ldquo;The Lord&rdquo; had
&ldquo;sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a Priest for ever
after the order of Melchisedec&rdquo; (Ps. cx. 4).&nbsp; And then
to show that He needed not even the legions to rescue Him, but
had still all power in His hands, when about to be &ldquo;brought
as a lamb to the slaughter&rdquo; (Isa. liii. 7), as soon as He
had said to the band of men and officers who came with Judas to
take Him, &ldquo;<i>I am He</i>&rdquo; they went backwards and
fell to the ground (John xviii. 3&ndash;7), signifying that they
had no power to touch Him until again encouraged by Jesus.&nbsp;
And so at each step of His trial, mocking, scourging, until by
wicked hands He was crucified and slain (Acts ii. 23)&mdash;it
was: &ldquo;Thou couldst have no power against Me except it were
given Thee from above&rdquo; (John xix. 11).&nbsp; At each step
it was His <a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
53</span>voluntary submission to ignominy and insult, and a cruel
death, that He might redeem us from death, and from the power of
the grave and of hell by His own blood.</p>

54</span>CHAPTER IV.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">TESTIMONY OF THE OLD TESTAMENT PROPHECIES TO
JESUS CHRIST AS THE MESSIAH.</p>
<p>We have thus endeavoured to point out in how comprehensive a
sense Jesus fulfilled the Law, so that one jot or one tittle
should not fail or be lost.</p>
<p>The Apostle Peter, in the third chapter of Acts, says,
&ldquo;Those things which God before <i>had showed by the mouth
of all His prophets</i>, that Christ should suffer, He hath so
fulfilled&rdquo; (ver. 18).</p>
<p>It was the beneficent design of our Heavenly Father that so
many rays of light, passing through varied channels, and spread
over all past time, should concentrate upon Jesus as the Lamb of
God that <a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
55</span>taketh away the sin of the world, that there might be no
excuse for rejecting Him.&nbsp; Let us recall some of the
principal passages in which the Old Testament Scriptures refer to
our Lord and His kingdom.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; His coming was prophesied from the fall of Adam and
Eve, in the Lord&rsquo;s address to the serpent, thus, &ldquo;The
seed of the woman shall bruise thy head, but thou shalt bruise
his heel&rdquo; (Gen. iii. 15), a prophecy obscure at first, but
abundantly explained by subsequent history and prophecy.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; The promise was made to Abraham and renewed to Isaac
and Jacob, that in their seed, all the families of the earth
should be blessed (Gen. xii. 3, xxii. 18, xxvi. 4).</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; The family of Jacob was chosen to be a peculiar
people to the Lord.&nbsp; Laws, sacrifices, and institutions were
given them to be as a schoolmaster to lead them to Christ, and it
was declared the sceptre <a name="page56"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 56</span>&ldquo;shall not depart from Judah
until Shiloh come&rdquo; (Gen. xlix. 10).</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; As time progressed the covenant was further confirmed
and limited to the tribe of Judah, and the family of Jesse, and,
again, of David.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; The <i>time</i> of the Messiah&rsquo;s advent was
closely indicated by the prophecy of Daniel; seventy weeks of
years, or 490 years from the rebuilding of Jerusalem (Dan. ix.
24, 25).</p>
<p>It was to be during the continuance of the second Temple, and
when there should be a general expectation and desire in all
nations for Him (Hag. ii. 6&ndash;9).&nbsp; He would be preceded
by a forerunner, who would prepare His way (Mal. iii. 1).</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; The <i>place</i> of His birth was pointed out by
Micah (v. 2) as Bethlehem of Judah.&nbsp; He was to be born of a
virgin, and called Immanuel&mdash;&ldquo;God with us&rdquo; (Isa.
vii. 14).&nbsp; He was to commence His teaching in Galilee (Isa.
ix. 1, 2).</p>
<p><a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
57</span>7.&nbsp; The <i>character</i> of His mediatorial coming;
His humble origin; His lowly, suffering life, and His cruel
death&mdash;were described with singular accuracy by the Prophet
Isaiah;&mdash;as well as the ultimate glory of His Kingdom and
reign.&nbsp; And the Psalms abound in references to the
sufferings of Christ, often spoken as of David, but having their
full accomplishment in Him who was emphatically &ldquo;the Son of
David.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was natural that the <i>worldly-minded Jews</i>, in
anticipating their Messiah, and looking for one greater than
Solomon, should expect to see one exceeding him, not only in
wisdom, but in that outward display of wealth and grandeur which
the world so much admires, as indicating the royal power and pomp
of kings.&nbsp; But it was not so to be: &ldquo;He shall grow up
before Him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground;
He hath no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see Him <a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>there is no
beauty that we should desire Him.&rdquo;&nbsp; He would bear our
griefs and carry our sorrows while He was &ldquo;despised and
rejected of men,&rdquo; and numbered with the transgressors (Isa.
liii.).</p>
<p>He should be the mighty God, the Everlasting Father (Isa. ix.
6), whose goings forth have been from of old&mdash;from
everlasting (Micah v. 2).&nbsp; &ldquo;A prophet like unto Moses,
him shall ye hear&rdquo; (Deut. xviii. 15, 18).</p>
<p>8.&nbsp; Subsequent to the close of the Old Testament
prophecy, some very remarkable incidents marked, to the believing
Jews, the near approach and the actual coming of their
Messiah.</p>
<p>The angel Gabriel appeared to Zacharias as he ministered in
the priest&rsquo;s office, to announce the approaching birth of
John the Baptist, who should &ldquo;go before, to make ready a
people prepared for the Lord&rdquo; (Luke i. 17).&nbsp; This
visitation was made on a very public occasion, on the <a
name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>great Day of
Atonement, while &ldquo;the whole multitude of the people were
praying without at the time of incense&rdquo; (Luke i. 10).&nbsp;
The angel Gabriel appeared also to the Virgin Mary to tell her
that she should be blessed among women in giving birth to the
Messiah (ver. 28), and &ldquo;all these sayings were noised
abroad throughout all the hill country of Judea&rdquo; (Luke i.
65).</p>
<p><i>The actual birth</i> of our Lord was next announced by an
angel to the shepherds, saying, &ldquo;Unto you is born this day,
in the city of David, a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord&rdquo;
(Luke ii. 11); &ldquo;and suddenly there was with the angel a
multitude of the heavenly host, praising God and saying, Glory to
God in the highest and on earth peace, goodwill toward men&rdquo;
(Luke ii. 14).</p>
<p>While God in His providence provides abundant evidence for the
believing heart, yet it is not so redundant that none can reject
it.&nbsp; It is the eye of faith which discerns <a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>God in
prophecy, or providence, or nature, and the opening of that eye
is the effect of grace in the heart, at first comparatively small
and mixed with more or less of misgiving, as when Nathanael said,
&ldquo;Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?&rdquo; (John i.
46) but growing with the increase of Divine grace as when he was
able afterwards to say, &ldquo;Rabbi, thou art the Son of God,
thou art the King of Israel&rdquo; (John i. 49).</p>
<p>Let us consider two examples illustrating this principle.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; That of Simeon, a righteous and devout man, looking
for the consolation of Israel, waiting for and expecting the
fulfilment of prophecy, who finding the infant Jesus in the
temple, received Him into his arms, and blessed God, and said,
&ldquo;Lord, now lettest Thou Thy servant depart in peace,
according to Thy word; for mine eyes have seen Thy salvation,
which Thou hast prepared before the face of all people; <a
name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>a light to
lighten the Gentiles and the glory of Thy people Israel&rdquo;
(Luke ii. 29&ndash;31).</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; That of Herod, and the people of the Jews generally,
when the wise men came to Jerusalem, saying they had seen the
king&rsquo;s star in the east, and were come to inquire where he
was to be born.&nbsp; The chief priest and scribes, who with the
people generally were also in expectation of the promised
Messiah, said he should be born in Bethlehem, and referred to the
prophetic declaration in that respect; but their unbelieving
hearts were aroused, and all Jerusalem was in an uproar, prepared
to say, as they did at last, &ldquo;We will not have this man to
rule over us.&rdquo;&nbsp; Herod also, fearing a rival king, sent
forth his soldiers to destroy the child, by killing with
undistinguishing cruelty, all the children from two years old and
younger.</p>
<p>In addition to the prophecies which marked the <i>descent</i>
of our Lord, and the <i>time</i> and <i>character</i> of His
coming, there are <a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
62</span>numerous references made in the Old Testament to
circumstances of His personal history while He dwelt amongst
men.</p>
<p>He should preach good tidings unto the meek, bind up the
broken-hearted, proclaim liberty to the captive, and comfort all
that mourn (Isa. lxi. 1, 2).</p>
<p>He should open the blind eyes, unstop the deaf ears, make the
lame to leap as a hart, and the tongue of the dumb to sing (Isa.
xxxv. 5, 6; xxix. 18).</p>
<p>He should feed His flock like <i>a shepherd</i> (Isa. xl. 11);
&ldquo;I will set one <i>shepherd</i> over them, even My servant
David&rdquo; (Ezek. xxxiv. 23).&nbsp; &ldquo;A king shall reign
and prosper, and this is the name whereby He shall be called, the
<i>Lord our Righteousness</i>&rdquo; (Jer. xxiii. 5, 6).</p>
<p>He was &ldquo;to be a priest for ever, after the order of
Melchesidec&rdquo; (Ps. ex. 4).&nbsp; &ldquo;He shall be a priest
upon His throne&rdquo; (Zech. vi. 13).</p>
<p>He should be for a &ldquo;sanctuary&rdquo; (Isa. <a
name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>viii. 14); a
&ldquo;rock and place of refuge&rdquo; (Ps. xci. 1).</p>
<p>He should &ldquo;enter Jerusalem riding on an ass&rsquo;s
colt&rdquo; (Zech. ix. 9).</p>
<p>He should &ldquo;be higher than the kings of the
earth.&rdquo;&nbsp; His throne should &ldquo;endure as the
sun&rdquo; (Ps. lxxxix. 27, 36).</p>
<p>He should &ldquo;open His mouth in a parable, and utter dark
sayings of old&rdquo; (Ps. lxxviii. 2; Isa. vi. 9, 10, compared
with Matt. xiii. 14).</p>
<p>The rulers should &ldquo;take counsel together against
Him&rdquo; (Ps. ii. 2).</p>
<p>His &ldquo;own familiar friend, who did eat of His
bread,&rdquo; should &ldquo;lift up his heel against Him&rdquo;
(Ps. xli. 9).</p>
<p>&ldquo;They weighed for my price thirty pieces of silver, and
cast them to the potter in the House of the Lord&rdquo; (Zech.
xi. 12, 13).&nbsp; &ldquo;They gave me gall for my meat, and in
my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink&rdquo; (Ps. lxix.
21).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bone of Him should be broken&rdquo; <a
name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>(Ex. xii. 46;
Ps. xxxiv. 20).&nbsp; &ldquo;He should give His back to the
smitters, and His cheeks to them that plucked off the
hair.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;He hid not His face from shame and
spitting&rdquo; (Isa. l. 6).</p>
<p>The assembly of the wicked should enclose
Him&mdash;&ldquo;they pierced my hands and my feet&rdquo; (Ps.
xxii. 16).&nbsp; &ldquo;They part my garments among them, and
cast lots upon my vesture&rdquo; (Ps. xxii. 18).&nbsp; &ldquo;All
they that see me laugh me to scorn; they shoot out the lip; they
shake the head, saying, He trusted on the Lord that He would
deliver Him; let Him deliver Him, seeing He delighted in
Him&rdquo; (Ps. xxii. 7, 8).</p>
<p>He should &ldquo;make His grave with the wicked, and with the
rich in His death, because He had done no violence, neither was
any deceit in His mouth&rdquo; (Isa. liii. 9).</p>
<p>He should &ldquo;make intercession for the
transgressors&rdquo; (Isa. liii. 12).&nbsp; &ldquo;Father,
forgive them, for they know not what they do.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>He
should rise from the dead (Ps. xvi. 10), ascend into heaven, and
receive gifts for men, even &ldquo;for the rebellious also, that
the Lord God might dwell among them&rdquo; (Ps. lxviii. 18).</p>
<p>He should &ldquo;pour out His Spirit on all flesh, so that
their sons and daughters should prophesy,&rdquo; &amp;c. (Joel
ii. 28).</p>
<p>To &ldquo;one like unto the Son of Man&rdquo; was to be given
&ldquo;dominion and glory and a kingdom, that all peoples,
nations, and languages, should serve Him; His dominion is an
everlasting dominion which shall not pass away, and His kingdom
that which shall not be destroyed&rdquo; (Dan. vii. 13, 14).</p>
<p>With what justice could the Lord say, &ldquo;Search the
Scriptures, for in them ye think ye have Eternal Life, and they
are they which testify of Me?&rdquo; (John v. 39).&nbsp;
&ldquo;And if I had not done among them the works which none
other man did, they had not had sin, but now they <a
name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>have no cloke
for their sin&rdquo; (John xv. 24, 22) <a
name="citation66"></a><a href="#footnote66"
class="citation">[66]</a></p>
<p>If such were the evidences furnished to <i>the Jews</i>, the
<i>Gentile</i> who rests his hope on Christ as the Rock of Ages
can equally enter into and appreciate these proofs of our
Lord&rsquo;s mission, and unite in the triumphant song of David,
&ldquo;Go round about Zion, tell the towers thereof; mark ye well
her bulwarks; consider her palaces, that ye may tell it to the
generation following; for this God is our God for ever and ever,
He will be our guide even unto death&rdquo; (Ps. xlviii. 13,
14).&nbsp; As Gentiles we can also look back to the fall of the
peculiar institutions designed to point out the Messiah to
mankind,&mdash;to <a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
67</span>the present state of His chosen people, scattered
throughout the Gentile world in fulfilment of their own
prophecies,&mdash;to the triumphs of the faith in
Christ,&mdash;and to the multitudes who have already been
admitted to realise the mansions in the heaven which He went to
prepare for them.</p>
<p>As Christianity is itself built on the foundation of the
<i>Law</i>, the <i>Prophets</i>, and the <i>Psalms</i>, in fact
upon whatever of Divine revelation had preceded it, and is the
crowning development of the whole, we may not disregard or
lightly esteem any portion of that outward work of Christ, of
which our blessings are the direct result, and without which we
could have no right or title to them.</p>
<p>The new Covenant of Grace was declared by Christ and His
Apostles.&nbsp; The seal of that Covenant was the Blood of Jesus,
the voluntary offering of Himself for the sins of men, as
typified by the <a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
68</span>patriarchal and Mosaic institutions.&nbsp; It was the
purchase of our redemption, and of all those gifts and graces of
the Holy Spirit which the Lord Jesus after His resurrection gave
to men (Eph. iv. 8, 11; Rom. xii. 6, 8; 1 Cor. xii. 4;
&amp;c.).&nbsp; Thus He is the &ldquo;foundation stone,&rdquo;
the &ldquo;tried stone,&rdquo; the &ldquo;chief
corner-stone,&rdquo; and &ldquo;only hope of glory.&rdquo;&nbsp;
By Himself He &ldquo;<i>purges</i> our sins.&rdquo;&nbsp; By His
<i>death</i> He delivers &ldquo;them who through fear of death,
are all their life time subject to bondage&rdquo; (Heb. ii. 14,
15).&nbsp; And does not the continual daily sacrifice, morning by
morning, and evening by evening, prescribed by the Law, point to
the constant bearing on our minds before God, of the sacrifice of
Christ, as the foundation of all our hopes, and petitions for
mercy and grace? the true propitiatory, or mercy seat, where God
will meet with us and dwell with us (see page 16, and Ex. xxix.
42, 45).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatsoever things were written aforetime, <a
name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>were written
for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the
Scriptures might have hope&rdquo; (Rom. xv. 4).</p>
<p>&ldquo;All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is
profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for
instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be perfect,
throughly furnished unto all good works&rdquo; (2 Tim. iii. 16,
17).</p>
<p>Nor need any be discouraged; the Bible is God&rsquo;s
revelation addressed alike to all men, rich or poor, learned or
unlearned, intellectual or of small powers.&nbsp; God is no
respecter of persons, and to every one alike who can read for
themselves, or hear from others, the Bible, without note or
comment, may prove under the influence of God&rsquo;s Spirit,
&ldquo;a lamp unto their feet, a light to their
path.&rdquo;&nbsp; The less educated will escape some of the
difficulties which beset the minds of others, and more easily
fulfil the conditions imposed by our Lord, &ldquo;Except ye
receive the kingdom of God <a name="page70"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 70</span>as little children, ye cannot enter
therein;&rdquo; and many are the instances in which persons of
comparatively small intellectual power enjoy, appreciate, and
bring forth the evident fruits of faith; so that, with the Bible
in their hands and the Holy Spirit to apply it, none need despair
of finding the way that leads to everlasting life.</p>
<p>The Psalmist asks, &ldquo;Wherewithall shall a young man
cleanse his way?&rdquo; and replies, &ldquo;By taking heed
thereto according to Thy word&rdquo; (Ps. cxix. 9), so that he
may come to say, &ldquo;O, how I love Thy law, it is my
meditation all the day&rdquo; (ver. 97).&nbsp; &ldquo;Thou
through Thy commandments hast made me wiser than mine enemies;
for they are ever with me&rdquo; (ver. 98).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thy testimonies have I taken as an heritage for ever;
they are the rejoicing of my heart&rdquo; (ver. 111).</p>

72</span>CHAPTER V.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">THE GOSPEL OF CHRIST.</p>
<p>Having in the former pages noticed the manner in which the
institutions of previous revelation have pointed to and been
completed by the Gospel of Christ, let us now set forth some of
the leading characteristics of that religion which Jesus, so long
foretold and typified, came to introduce amongst men.</p>
<p>We must bear in mind that it was a <i>New Covenant</i> with
men, which He came to establish.&nbsp; The former Covenant had
grown old, and was about to decay; and it had been declared in
prophecy, &ldquo;This shall be the covenant that I will make with
the house of Israel; after those days, saith the Lord, I will put
my law in their <a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
73</span>inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be
their God, and they shall be my people.&nbsp; And they shall
teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother,
saying, Know the Lord: for they shall all know Me from the least
of them unto the greatest of them, saith the Lord: for I will
forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no
more&rdquo; (Jer. xxxi. 33 and 34).</p>
<p>He who came to establish this new Covenant, and teach it to
men, was none other than the Word who was in the beginning with
God and was God.&nbsp; All things were made by Him; and without
Him was not anything made that was made (John i. 1&ndash;3); who
was the brightness of the Father&rsquo;s glory, and &ldquo;the
express image of His person, and upholding all things by the word
of His power&rdquo; (Heb. i. 3).</p>
<p>It is no marvel therefore that the New Testament should teach
us that the first <a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
74</span>and cardinal point of this new faith was that we should
believe on the &ldquo;Messenger of the Covenant&rdquo;&mdash;the
Lord Jesus Christ bearing glad tidings of salvation to all
men.</p>
<p>This is done in the clearest and most precise manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten
Son, that <i>whosoever believeth</i> in Him should not perish,
but <i>have everlasting life</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For God sent not His Son into the world to condemn the
world; but that the world <i>through Him might be
saved</i>&rdquo; (John iii. 16, 17).</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the work of God, that <i>ye believe on Him</i>
whom He hath sent&rdquo; (John vi. 29).</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is life eternal, that they might know Thee the
only true God, and <i>Jesus Christ whom Thou hast sent</i>&rdquo;
(John xvii. 3).</p>
<p>&ldquo;He that believeth on the Son <i>hath </i><a
name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
75</span><i>everlasting life</i>: and he that believeth not the
Son <i>shall not see life</i>; but the wrath of <i>God abideth on
him</i>&rdquo; (John iii. 36).</p>
<p>&ldquo;He that heareth My word, and believeth on Him that sent
Me, hath everlasting life&rdquo; (John v. 24).</p>
<p>&ldquo;He <i>that believeth on Him is not condemned</i>: but
<i>he that believeth not is condemned already</i>, because he
hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of
God&rdquo; (John iii. 18).</p>
<p>&ldquo;But as many as received Him, to them gave He power to
become the sons of God, even <i>to them that believe on His
name</i>&rdquo; (John i. 12).</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am the resurrection and the life: <i>he that
believeth in Me</i>, though he were dead, yet shall he
live&rdquo; (John xi. 25).</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ</i>, <i>and thou
shalt be saved</i>&rdquo; (Acts xvi. 31).</p>
<p>In the two verses quoted above, John iii. 16, 17, God is
declared to send His Son not to condemn, but to save the
world.</p>
<p><a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>Verse
18 divides mankind into two classes&mdash;those who <i>believe in
Christ</i>, and those who <i>do not believe</i>.&nbsp; The former
are <i>not condemned</i>, and if they abide in Him will go on to
everlasting life.&nbsp; The latter &ldquo;are <i>condemned
already</i>&rdquo; for their not believing.&nbsp; This
condemnation is not necessarily a final state, for if they
&ldquo;abide not in unbelief,&rdquo; but turn to Christ in
repentance and faith, they will be brought into His covenant of
grace and salvation.&nbsp; But if otherwise, when God&rsquo;s
longsuffering patience has exhausted the pleadings, warnings, and
wooings of the Spirit without response, a time must come when the
word will go forth, &ldquo;My Spirit shall not always strive with
man;&rdquo; and that state of condemnation become an abiding one,
agreeably to Rom. ii. 4&ndash;10.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or despisest thou the riches of His goodness and
forbearance and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of
God leadeth thee to repentance?&nbsp; But <a
name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>after thy
hardness and impenitent heart, treasurest up unto thyself wrath,
against the day of wrath, and revelation of the righteous
judgment of God; who will render to every man according to his
deeds:&mdash;To them who by patient continuance in well doing
seek for glory and honour and immortality, eternal life: but unto
them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey
unrighteousness, indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguish,
upon every soul of man that doeth evil . . . but glory, honour,
and peace to every man that worketh good&rdquo; (Rom. ii.
4&ndash;10).</p>
<p>It becomes, therefore, an all-important point to endeavour to
draw from Scripture some of the chief conditions which are
implied in these simple words, &ldquo;<i>Believing in the Lord
Jesus Christ</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our Lord has Himself given us an example of what He meant by
it when He said, &ldquo;I seek <i>not mine own will</i>, but
<i>the </i><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
78</span><i>will of the Father</i> which hath sent Me&rdquo;
(John v. 30).&nbsp; Jesus believed in the Father, and he that in
like manner believes in the Son must seek, not his own will, but
the will of Christ.</p>
<p>Jesus said, &ldquo;I am the Light of the world;&rdquo;
&ldquo;he that followeth Me shall not walk in darkness, but shall
have the light of life&rdquo; (John viii. 12).&nbsp; &ldquo;I am
<i>the way</i>, <i>the truth</i>, and <i>the life</i>; no man
cometh unto the Father but by Me&rdquo; (John xiv. 6).&nbsp; He
is the <i>way</i> to the Father, and the <i>only
way</i>:&mdash;the very <i>Truth</i> of God expressed in word and
action,&mdash;in precept and example,&mdash;who &ldquo;did no
sin, neither was guile found in His mouth&rdquo; (1 Pet. ii. 22;
and Isa. liii. 9),&mdash;and <i>the life</i>, the means through
which alone spiritual life is given to a world dead in trespasses
and sins.</p>
<p>Our Lord further defines the characteristics of the two
classes as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;For every one that doeth evil
hateth <a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>the
light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be
reproved.&nbsp; But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that
his deeds may be made manifest that they are wrought in
God&rdquo; (John iii. 20, 21).</p>
<p>It is, therefore, a characteristic of believing in Jesus that
we bring our &ldquo;deeds to <i>His light</i> that it may be made
manifest that they are wrought in God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jesus was &ldquo;<i>the Light</i>&rdquo; but His precepts and
example&mdash;all, in fact, that He did and taught&mdash;are so
many lights derived from Him; as well as the light of the Holy
Ghost or Comforter, who shines in our hearts to give &ldquo;us
the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of
Jesus Christ&rdquo; (2 Cor. iv.&nbsp; 6); and this bringing our
deeds to the light includes trying them by His words and
example;&mdash;the precepts taught by His Apostles, as well as by
the Holy Spirit itself,&mdash;that by any or all of these
accordant tests <a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
80</span>it may be made clear whether they are according to the
mind of Christ.&nbsp; &ldquo;He that hath My commandments, and
<i>keepeth them</i>, he it is <i>that loveth Me</i>. . . .&nbsp;
He that <i>loveth Me not</i>, <i>keepeth not</i> My
sayings&rdquo; (John xiv. 21, 24).</p>
<p>We have a lively illustration of practical belief in the
patriarchs of old, who, believing in God&rsquo;s promises, and
having seen them afar off, embraced them, and shaped their lives
in conformity to them:&mdash;viz., &ldquo;These all died in
faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them
afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and
confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims in the
earth.&nbsp; For they which say such things declare plainly that
they seek . . . a better country&mdash;that is, a heavenly&rdquo;
(Heb. xi. 13, 14, 16).</p>
<p>Believing in Christ, therefore, implies a belief that He is
the Son of God, the Messiah, and Saviour of the world, the <a
name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>centre and
spring of all our spiritual existence;&mdash;a belief in His
<i>teaching expressed by</i> shaping our lives and conversation
in the world by it; accepting Him as our King, whose right it is
to reign and rule in our hearts.&nbsp; He tells us that we must
be &ldquo;born again&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;born of the
Spirit&rdquo; (John iii. 3 and 6)&mdash;and the power to truly
believe in Christ is coincident with this new birth, and
indicative of it, when &ldquo;the Holy Ghost or Comforter,&rdquo;
convincing us of sin, and of our alienation from God by it,
enables us to look to Jesus as our Saviour and Redeemer.&nbsp;
When, by the power of the same Spirit, we are enabled to lay
aside our old works, thoughts, and propensities to evil, and walk
by the rule of faith in the light of the Spirit of Christ.&nbsp;
As we abide and walk therein, we shall &ldquo;grow in grace and
in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ;&rdquo;
bringing forth the fruits of the Spirit, which are set forth in
<a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>Gal. v.
22, as &ldquo;love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness,
goodness, faith, meekness, temperance; against such there is no
law.&rdquo;&nbsp; Again (2 Pet. i. 5&ndash;7),
as&mdash;&ldquo;Faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience,
godliness, brotherly kindness, and charity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If we examine the nature of some of these fruits of the
Spirit, we shall see that though they are produced in us
individually by the working of the Spirit, they are not confined
to ourselves, but will communicate to others around us.&nbsp;
Thus we all know how communicative is the feeling of
<i>joy</i>&mdash;it burns to tell others the good news, or glad
tidings.&nbsp; The <i>love</i> of God shed abroad in our hearts
makes us long that others should participate in this great
blessing.&mdash;The <i>peace</i> of God yearns that all should be
brought into its heavenly atmosphere: while the other qualities
or rather graces described,&mdash;as longsuffering, meekness,
charity, &amp;c,&mdash;mark to others that we have <a
name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>been with
Jesus: and the Apostle Peter winds up his catalogue with the
descriptive words equally applicable to both, &ldquo;<i>If these
things be in you and abound</i>, they make you that ye shall
neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord
Jesus Christ&rdquo; (2 Pet. i. 8).</p>
<p>Thus the Gospel &ldquo;is the power of God unto salvation to
everyone that believeth&rdquo; (Rom. i. 16), and as its fruits
spring up and <i>abound</i> in any heart they will in some or
other form overflow to those around, and make it a minister of
righteousness, a testimony-bearer to the truth as it is in Jesus:
it may be in word and doctrine, in the private circle of
association, or even in the quiet testimony of a peaceful spirit,
and a faithful discharge of duties, recommending by its example
the Gospel of Christ.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the <i>law of the Spirit of life in Christ
Jesus</i> hath made me free from <i>the law of sin and death</i>.
. . .&nbsp; That <i>the </i><a name="page84"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 84</span><i>righteousness of the law</i> might
be fulfilled in us, <i>who walk not after the flesh</i>, <i>but
after the Spirit</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;For they that are after
the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they <i>that are
after the Spirit the things of the Spirit</i>&rdquo; (Rom. viii.
2&ndash;5).</p>
<p>Allusion has been made at a former page (<span
class="indexpageno"><a href="#page40">40</a></span>) to the
<i>precepts of the law</i>, having been superseded by the higher
<i>principles</i> of the Gospel of Christ.&nbsp; The New
Testament, instead of prescribing precise instructions for
conduct between man and man, sums up our duties in the general
principle, &ldquo;Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself; love
worketh no ill to his neighbour; love is the fulfilling of the
law&rdquo; (Rom. xiii. 9, 10); at the same time illustrations are
given, both of the fruits of the Spirit, and of the fruits of sin
in the heart (See Eph. iv. 22 to end, and ch. v.; Rom. i.
28&ndash;32; Rev. xxi. 8).</p>
<p>The law written in the heart is the effect of the Holy
Spirit&rsquo;s work there.&nbsp; <a name="page85"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 85</span>He works in us to will and to do of
God&rsquo;s good pleasure;&mdash;&ldquo;to do those things which
are well pleasing in His sight;&rdquo;&mdash;which should
&ldquo;be known and read of all men,&rdquo; by its effects on the
conduct, &amp;c. (2 Cor. iii. 2).&nbsp; It was the distinguishing
feature of Christ&rsquo;s coming&mdash;&ldquo;Lo, I come to do
Thy will, O God&rdquo; (Heb. x. 9).&nbsp; And though we cannot
attain to His perfection, the work of the Spirit is always to
beget within us more of the love of God, and to incline our
hearts to serve Him more faithfully.&nbsp; As we sit, as it were,
at the feet of Jesus, looking unto Him, the Spirit or Comforter
will take of the things of Christ, and show them to us, and there
will be a growth in grace, and in conformity to the will and law
of God;&mdash;a subordination of the flesh to the Spirit, which
has no necessary, or perhaps no natural, limit, but in the
summons to quit the militant, and join the triumphant, Church
above.</p>
<p><a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>It is
sometimes said that Christianity is an educational system in
which the mind is trained, by the restoring grace of the Holy
Spirit, to abandon sin, and work righteousness; and that the
offer of this restoring grace implies, as a necessary prelude,
the pardon of past sin.</p>
<p>Enough has been already said to show that this is not
consistent with the general tenor of Holy Scripture.&nbsp; We
know that the minds of susceptible children, nurtured under
Christian mothers, do sometimes drink in the truths of the Gospel
from their lips, at a very early age, in a way that makes it
difficult to mark the period of decided change in them.&nbsp;
They seem to grow up with the Gospel infused into their
characters and life.</p>
<p>This is not, however, the common case; neither is it the happy
lot of <i>all</i> to be so instructed from their cradles to
maturity.&nbsp; And when sin has taken possession of the
mind&mdash;whether in the milder development <a
name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>of what is
called innocent gaiety;&mdash;the love of pleasure, without
vice;&mdash;indisposition for serious things and
persons;&mdash;or whether evil takes a larger development, and
vice in its grosser form exists; in either case they cannot be
said to believe in the Lord Jesus Christ&mdash;nor, as a
consequence, to seek to do His will; but are living under the
condemnation of those who do not believe.&nbsp; And these states,
admitted and protracted, necessarily tend to harden in sin, and
the longer they continue, to render it more difficult to return,
repent, and live.&nbsp; So that in general it is when the fear of
death is brought nearer by sickness:&mdash;when aroused by the
powerful ministry of the Word, or by the direct pleadings of the
Holy Spirit, convincing us of sin and of judgment to
come:&mdash;then, if at all, they are arrested in their downward
course, and, through God&rsquo;s longsuffering mercy, are brought
to see their need of a Saviour, a <a name="page88"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 88</span>Redeemer, a sacrifice for sin.&nbsp;
Under such circumstances <i>no necessary implication of
pardon</i> will give <i>peace</i>; they must feel that Jesus
<i>has borne their sins in His own body on the tree</i>, <i>and
that by His stripes they are healed</i>.</p>
<p>How many instances do we read of persons, for long years
refusing to yield themselves to God, being at length brought into
such depths of misery or danger (in that longsuffering mercy
which has followed them all through), and then are they enabled
to repent and put away their sins, and, believing on the Lord
Jesus Christ, to be saved from the wrath to come.</p>
<p>But some, perhaps, will say: Why cannot I believe in the Lord
Jesus as &ldquo;the restorer of breaches,&rdquo; and &ldquo;of
paths to dwell in,&rdquo; without going back to past ages?&nbsp;
The answer is very obvious&mdash;that if He be not the Sacrifice,
He cannot be the Restorer.&nbsp; He is <i>one</i> Christ, and His
<a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>work
<i>one</i>.&nbsp; If He atones for the sin of mankind, He can be
then the restorer;&mdash;the one is as much part of His character
as the other.&nbsp; And if we would divide His perfect work in
two parts, and reject Him when suffering on the cross for our
sins:&mdash;that &ldquo;we might live&rdquo;:&mdash;&ldquo;to
give His life a ransom for us,&rdquo;&mdash;can we be sure that
He will acknowledge us when seated on the right hand of
God?&nbsp; Can we be truly said to believe in Him with our
<i>whole</i> heart?&nbsp; <i>If</i> we do not accept what He has
said of Himself; by His own rule we are not seeking to do His
will.</p>
<p>It is <i>after</i> &ldquo;<i>having made peace through the
blood of His cross</i>;&rdquo; . . . that He <i>is able</i>
&ldquo;<i>to reconcile all things unto Himself</i>&rdquo; (Col.
i. 19, 20), so that they who &ldquo;were sometimes alienated by
wicked works, yet now hath He reconciled in the body of <i>His
flesh through death</i>, to present you holy and unblameable, and
unreproveable in His sight.&rdquo; (Col. i. 22).</p>
<p><a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>In the
previous chapters of the Epistle to the Romans, Paul, having
taken a review of the mercies of God in human redemption by
Christ, and of the calling of the Jews and Gentiles;&mdash;in the
twelfth chapter he beseeches the brethren &ldquo;to present their
bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is
their reasonable service&rdquo; (ver. 1); and at the end of the
thirteenth chapter he exhorts them to &ldquo;put on the Lord
Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfil the
lust thereof&rdquo; (ver. 14); while the intermediate verses
contain a remarkably concise epitome of the character and duties
of the members of the Christian Church.</p>
<p>I have endeavoured to draw the character of Christianity as I
find it in the New Testament.&nbsp; No place is made for
lukewarmness, indifference, or formality.&nbsp; Every one
receiving the inestimable blessing of faith in Christ is
naturally expected <a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
91</span>to embrace it; to prize it as the &ldquo;pearl of great
price&rdquo;; the greatest of all treasures; and to be wrapped up
in its excellence, counting all other things as valueless and
unworthy of attention in comparison with it.&nbsp; And the new
creature is to grow up out of the new faith, stripped of all that
is old and sinful, and clothed with all that is just and true and
godly.</p>
<p>To flee from the &ldquo;wrath to come,&rdquo; and take refuge
in the ark or fold of Christ, is a work of the deepest
seriousness, and the joy of feeling that you have attained that
shelter and security is depicted in the New and Old Testaments as
of the liveliest kind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rejoice in the Lord alway: and again I say
rejoice&rdquo; (Phil. iv. 4).&nbsp; &ldquo;Whom having not seen
ye love; in whom though now ye see Him not, yet, believing, ye
rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory&rdquo; (1 Pet. i.
8), and this in the midst of grievous persecutions.</p>
<p><a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
92</span>&ldquo;And thou shalt <i>rejoice in the Lord</i>, and
shalt glory in the Holy One of Israel&rdquo; (Isa. xli. 16).</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will greatly rejoice in the Lord, my soul shall be
joyful in my God; for He hath clothed me with the garments of
salvation, He hath covered me with the robe of
righteousness&rdquo; (Isa. lxi. 10).</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will rejoice in the Lord, and joy in the God of my
salvation&rdquo; (Hab. iii. 18).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rejoice evermore&rdquo; (1 Thess. v. 16).</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is therefore now no condemnation to them which
are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh but after the
Spirit&rdquo; (Rom. viii. 1): born again of the Spirit: believing
in Christ: our sins borne by Him on the tree: &ldquo;the Spirit
of life in Christ Jesus making us free from the law of sin and
death&rdquo; (Rom. viii. 2), should we not rejoice with grateful
hearts, and through Jesus offer &ldquo;the sacrifice of praise to
God continually, that is, the fruit of <a name="page93"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 93</span>our lips giving thanks to His
name&rdquo;? (Heb. xiii. 15.)</p>
<p>But are there not many minds who are more given to dwell in a
low state, and in somewhat of that sombreness which is cast over
nature when the <i>sun</i> is more or less <i>eclipsed</i>, to
whom it is more congenial to look at the doubtful or dark side of
things, than to indulge in joyful anticipations?&nbsp; If such be
our condition of mind, should we not strive against it, and
examine whether there be not cause for joy?</p>
<p>If through the mercy of God in Christ Jesus our sins are
forgiven; if we have passed from death unto life; if Christ, who
is the appointed &ldquo;Judge of quick and dead,&rdquo; be <span
class="smcap">our</span> <i>Intercessor and Redeemer</i>, who is
he that can harm us?&nbsp; If by means of His redemption we are
made joint heirs with Him of the heavenly Kingdom and glory,
ought we not to rejoice and be glad?&nbsp; To have passed <a
name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>from darkness
to light, and from the power of Satan unto God is surely matter
for joy and rejoicing, and the feeling is one that it is the duty
of all such to encourage, and seek by prayer and meditation on
the promises of God in Christ Jesus&mdash;promises which are
<i>not yea and nay</i>, but <i>all yea</i> in Him&mdash;all
unconditional&mdash;absolutely certain to all who believe in,
love, and obey Him, and persevere to the end.</p>

Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
